1.	Which feature did you improve this week? Why did you choose it?
Automatically displaying weather data for a users location after an initital "use location" 
search request. This feature allows users to see weather data for their location without having 
to select "use location" every time they open or refresh the page. The function init () uses localStorage 
to store city, state, latitude, and longitude information and uses it to display it as 
soon as the app is opened. Additionally, I fixed the navigation bar to include the name of the app and the 
Celcius to Farenheit toggle button. To improve the UI and follow my figma design, I placed the search button
and "Use location" button next to one another. Finally, I added a new piece of error handling 
to the function getGeoLocation to throw a new error if the response fails.


2.	What issue or bug did you fix that you are most satisfied with?
To implement a "history" feature, I created the function recentlySearched()
which takes in the state, city, temp, and weather code to display a small card 
with information on previously searched locations. To store this information in localStorage,
I created the recentSearches array. When I first created this array, I was not checking if the
array contained items, but only pushing a new object into the array. This was causing the array 
to "reset" and only show one item that would change after every new search. To fix this,
I set it equal to "JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("recentlySearched")) || [];". This change 
checks if there are any items in the recentSearches array and if there is, add a new object into 
the array or create a new empty array. 


3.	What enhancement do you plan to work on during Week 15?
I will be improving the history feature to check if a city and state has already been 
entered into the recentSearches array to prevent duplication. Additionally, I will 
be updating the UI to follow the design I created in Figma, and adding a new function to display
different weather icons for the appropriate weather code.
